Unit Testing:
----------------------------------
You know the input You know the output
5,5 for adding
10 = 10 or not we check


Integration Testing - 10%

actual testing 
we will let everything happen with actual data
We will see entire call how it is happening.

Junit5 ->99% we use this for Unit testing\
we will some bugs or flaws in our logic with this

Mockito ->we mock some dummy data
In real time always giving a call to database is costly
hence we mock with some dummy instead of getting data from database.
we mock the bean and No repository call will be done.



src/test/java

@SpringBootTest //It marks class as test class
//It loads entire spring container and entire beans

Calculator.class      in src/main/java Folder
CalculatorTest.class  in src/test/java Folder

we autowired the class

we write methods and we put @Test annotation to check the methods
and we check with  assertEquals(20,res);

@Autowired
Calculator calculator;

@Test  //success check
public void testAddSuccess(){
int res = calculator.add(10,10)
assertEquals(20,res);
}

@Test //Failure check
public void testAddFailure(){
int res = calculator.add(10,10)
assertNotEquals(15,res);
}


@Test 
public void testSubFunction(){
int res = calculator.sub(10,5)
assertEquals(5,res);
}
